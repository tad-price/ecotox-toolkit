# ecotox-toolkit

This repository contains Pytorch implementations of models, datasets and evaluation functions that can be used for predicting the ecotoxicity of chemicals for aquatic species.

Currently supported datasets: ADORE, Synth-ADORE (coming soon)

Implemented models: Factorization Machine, MLP, MLP+dim reduction, Cross network; cVAE (coming soon)

Supported chemical features: mol2vec, fingerprints, SelFormer embeddings. Code can easily be extended to new features. 

Experiments: 

Visualisation and interpretation: SSD's (pending refactor)


This repository is built as part of a Master Thesis project at the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and Environment (RIVM).
